  <h1>| Who? |</h1>
  <h3> I'm classed as a MATURE student at the age of 27, how depressing. 27 and your already old.... </h3>

  <p> I decided to better my self by getting a degree within computer science so i was also to get a job that i could progress in.</p>
  <p>I've always been keen on education, i enjoy learning new skills even if this can come difficult to me due to my dxlyexia. </p>
  <p> Ive worked most of life either in retail or within my cureent job as a support worker for people with disabilites</p>
  <p>I'm not just a mature student but im also a wife and a mother of two beautful girls. I'm a proud mummy of my beautiful girls, but i want to show them that i you can achieve what you want if you put your mind to it.</p>
  <p>In this male dominated industry, i want to be one of the up and comming women to be taken seriously and to be given the chance to tailor my skills to the correct industry. I have many interest within the technolgy industry with my heart laying in cyber sercuity. Someone said to the 'you are only just starting within your career of technolgy dont tie yourself down within a sector you focuse on, embrace them all' and i intend to this.</p>
